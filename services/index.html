up to 30% of all assets under management of some Swiss banks coming from external asset managers. It is set 
to become an important pillar of the Asian wealth management landscape over the coming years as clients 
seek an alignment of interests and unbiased views from external asset managers to complement their current 
banking investment portfolios.</p>
<p>Our aim is to customise and develop the best possible strategies and solutions for your financial needs.</p>
<p>We understand that our clients appreciate the value of sound advice and our holistic approach towards wealth 
preservation and growth which is why we do not offer products or concentrate solely on aggressively growing 
their portfolios.</p>
<p>This alignment of interest combined with our open architecture allows us to work closely with the private 
banks and leverage on other financial institutions to provide a holistic and unbiased solution to each individual 
client’s needs.</p>
</section><section class="investment-philosophy"><h2>Investment philosophy</h2><p>Our investment philosophy is based on the belief that value can be added through active, fundamental management 
with a commitment to in-depth, bottom-up research and analysis. Our focused, nimble investment team makes portfolio 
decisions and are supported by global resources. Active risk management is integral to our investment process as we 
seek competitive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term.</p>
</section><section class="risk-management"><h2>Risk management</h2><p>Managing risk is a fundamental part of our approach to investing. Guided by this philosophy, our investment process 
aims to generate diversified and balanced portfolios with potential for out-performance over the long-term within 
controlled risk parameters. AT Asset Management has consistently applied its disciplined, value-driven approach to 
global and international markets investing.</p>
</section><hr/><section class="trusts"><h2>Trusts</h2><p>A family trust is a legal way to hold and protect your assets for you and your family for the future (e.g. investments 
or property). The assets will be owned by the trust rather than by an individual, and are managed by trustees (e.g. a 
family member, a lawyer, or an accountant) for the beneficiaries, who are usually family members.</p>
</section><section class="pic"><h2>PIC</h2><p>A PIC is a corporation established to hold your investment assets. Shareholders can appoint Directors, have management 
oversight of the PIC, enter into contracts, and delegate the operation of bank accounts to authorised signatories. 
The beneficial ownership, management and signatories of the PIC can be structured in multiple ways; yet it is a separate 
legal entity that offers privacy and wealth protection benefits.</p>
</section><section class="structuring"><h2>Structuring</h2><p>Whether you are looking to establish a new fund or raise new investment for an existing fund, we have necessary contacts to 
structure your fund in a tax efficient manner.</p>
</section><section class="universal-life-insurance"><h2>Universal life insurance</h2><p>This solution is designed for customers who want life insurance protection with potential cash value accumulation. Such 
plans provide the ability to leverage against the cash value with low initial cash outlay and high coverage. Many wealthy 
individuals invest in universal life insurance for legacy planning, business succession and continuity, and providing 
charitable gifts for their philanthropic goals.</p>
</section><section class="charitable-foundations"><h2>Charitable foundations</h2><p>If you or your family wish to make a meaningful and long-lasting contribution for a charitable purpose, a foundation could 
allow you to achieve your goals while maximising your tax and estate planning benefits. Many philanthropists set up non-profit 
organisations to fund a wide variety of charitable causes, whether for the advancement of education, healthcare, relief of 
poverty and other social well-being activities. In Singapore, registered charities will receive income tax exemption benefits.</p>
