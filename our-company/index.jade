h2.title Principles

section.introduction#principles
  :markdown
    Our principles and core values define the way we think and act. They sharpen our focus and act as our compass - which enables us to stay true to our fundamental purpose and beliefs, especially when we are faced with situations we have not come across before.

    Our client-first approach is committed to upholding the highest levels of integrity. To ensure this we exercise prudence and sound judgement combined with a considered approach to managing risks as we seek to deliver sustainable investment returns.

    Our investment philosophy is based on the belief that value can be added through active, fundamental management with a commitment to in-depth, bottom-up research and analysis. We believe that understanding and interpreting fundamentals are crucial to successfully navigating what lies ahead. Through collaboration and independent thought, we create an open environment that is conducive to producing excellence.
